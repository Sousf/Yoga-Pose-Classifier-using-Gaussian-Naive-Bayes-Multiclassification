1) The python file contains the Naive Bayes implementation
2) There are no extra requirements to run the implemented code
3) The test and train dataset must be kept within the same directory as the code to read them.
4) Naive bayes accuracy, micro averaging, macro averaging, weighted averaging, and feature engineering Naive Bayes accuracy are all printed to stdout.
